# The dream for KobuBox

KobuBox started as a small hack project — but the long-term dream looks like this:

- 🃏 **Printable card packs**  
  Bedtime stories, favourite albums/songs/playlists, routine cards, learning cards.  
  Kids decorate them, parents map them to media.

- 🧸 **A cozy, toy-like object**  
  Soft curves, friendly face, sits happily on a shelf or nightstand.  
  Feels more like a plush companion than a gadget.

- 🔌 **Built from standard parts**  
  ESP32, scanners, e-paper displays, buttons.  
  Repairable and modifiable without a secret "official" repair program.

- 🧩 **A platform, not a product trap**  
  Open firmware and hardware docs.  
  Community-made card sets, enclosures, forks.  
  Variants with RFID, NFC, or built-in speakers.

- 🕊 **No ads, no tracking, no dark patterns**  
  Just a little box that plays stories and music, quietly doing its job.

Right now, KobuBox is still very much **vaporware with a heart** — a work-in-progress lab project with sketches, prototypes, and half-finished firmware.

This page is where the dream lives while the real thing slowly catches up.
